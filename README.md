#Coin-classification-with-Convolution-Neural-Networks

The goal of the project is to design a convolutional network that classify
coin images into two classes:
1) Coins from the Roman times.
2) Other coins.
Two different datasets will be used:
1. The coinsdataset available from https://github.com/despoisj/CoinsDataset/blob/master/README.md
2. The Coin Image Dataset containing which is available from https://cvl.tuwien.ac.at/research/cvl-databases/coin-image-dataset/.
